        <h2>1. The life of Vincent van Gogh</h2>
        <p>The most important period of Van Gogh's career was the two years he spent in Arles. There he created many famous works, including "Starry Night", "Sunflowers" and the "Self-Portrait" series. However, he also experienced many psychological distress, including anxiety and depression. While in Arles, he also developed a friendship with Paul Gauguin, with whom he communicated and explored the field of art together.</p>
        <p>In 1890, Van Gogh moved to the French department of Auvers-Oise, where he was admitted to a mental hospital. There, his mental condition deteriorated and his creativity suffered some restrictions. Finally, he committed suicide on July 27, 1890, shooting himself in the chest. He died of a wound infection two days later at the age of 37.</p>
        <p> Van Gogh's work became widely recognized and appreciated after his death. Known for his unique style and emotional expression, his paintings had a profound impact on later generations of artists. His works are now collected in museums and art institutions around the world and have become part of the world's art treasure trove.</p>

        <h3>2. Van Gogh's artistic style</h3>
        <p>Vibrant Colors: Van Gogh's paintings are known for their bright and bold colors. He uses strong contrasts and pure colors to create works full of life and emotion.</p>
        <p>Bold Brushwork: Van Gogh's paintings possess distinctive brushwork, often rough and vigorous. He used quick, rough brushstrokes to convey emotions and energy, creating dynamics and tension on the canvas. </p>
        <p>Expression of Inner Emotions: Van Gogh's works are imbued with emotions and inner expressions. Through the use of color, brushwork, and composition, he directly communicated his inner feelings and emotional states. </p>
        <p>Later, he was driven by innovative literary and artistic trends and inspired by Japanese paintings. He boldly explored and freely expressed his inner feelings, pursued the expressive power of lines and colors, and pursued the three-dimensionality, decoration and allegorical nature of the picture.</p>

       <p>"Potato Eaters"</p>

       <p>"The Potato Eaters" portrays a poor family toiling all day, yet their dinner table is only adorned with potatoes. On the right side of the painting, an elderly woman's life burdens have stripped her of all joy. She mechanically pours coffee, her gaze avoiding any connection with the people at the table. On the left, a middle-aged man cautiously watches his mother across from him, seemingly burdened with guilt for his own appetite. Under the dim, yellowish light, the family sitting around the table still reveals a look of hunger and thirst in their eyes. In this moment of silence, their unspoken words seem to quietly convey their sorrows.</p>

         <p>"Café Terrace at Night"</p>

         <p>Van Gogh had a deep affection for the varied shades of blue in the southern sky, much like the radiant yellow that emerges from the earth under sunlight. In this artwork, he blends these two colors, creating a bright and vibrant composition. Van Gogh depicts the exterior of a café, with the bright lights from inside spilling onto the cobblestone square outside. In the deep blue night sky, the stars twinkle like brilliant fireworks. The overall atmosphere is warm and cozy, forming a striking contrast with the interior scene of the café he portrays.</p>

         <p>“Sunflowers”</p>

         <p>Van Gogh expressed himself through various flower poses in "Sunflowers", sometimes even comparing himself to a sunflower. The sunflowers in Van Gogh's paintings are golden in color, full of desire for life, as if they are burning, and the emotional strokes are so full and powerful. They are truly innocent, full of life and vigorous sunflowers. Painting sunflowers means painting the sun, and it is also self-painting. The sun, sunflowers and Van Gogh merge into one. Van Gogh and the sunflowers composed the blue and yellow symphony of mutual support and shared life, which is a symbol of his tragic life.</p>

         <p>"The Starry Night"</p>

         <p>The main color blue in the oil painting represents an unhappy and gloomy feeling. Very thick strokes represent sadness. The scene in the painting is one looking out of the window. The tree in the painting is a cypress, but it is painted like black tongues of fire, rising up into the clouds, which makes people feel uneasy. The sky is textured like a spiral galaxy with numerous star points, while the moon appears as a dim eclipse. In the whole painting, the villages at the bottom are painted with straight, thick and short lines, showing a kind of tranquility; but they are in strong contrast with the rough and curved lines in the upper part, which is reflected in this highly exaggerated deformation and strong visual contrast. It reveals the painter's restless emotions and psychedelic world of imagery.</p>

         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Vincent_van_Gogh_%281853-1890%29_-_Wheat_Field_with_Crows_%281890%29.jpg/600px-Vincent_van_Gogh_%281853-1890%29_-_Wheat_Field_with_Crows_%281890%29.jpg">
         <p>"Wheat field with Crows"</p>

         <p>This painting still has the familiar golden color that people are familiar with, but it is full of uneasiness and gloom. The heavy blue sky covered with dark clouds tightly suppresses the golden wheat fields, making it so heavy that it makes people breathless. It also seems to be frozen, with a group of messy low-flying crows, the undulating horizon and the violently beating agitated brushstrokes adding to the sense of oppression, resistance and uneasiness.</p>
